### 234. Palindrome Linked List
|Easy

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindromeor false otherwise.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
``` 

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].

0 <= Node.val <= 9
 

### Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
