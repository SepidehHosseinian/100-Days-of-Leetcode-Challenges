### 242. Valid Anagram
|Easy

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:
``````
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
``` 

### Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104

s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
