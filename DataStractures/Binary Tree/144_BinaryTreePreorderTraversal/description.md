### 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
|Easy

Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
