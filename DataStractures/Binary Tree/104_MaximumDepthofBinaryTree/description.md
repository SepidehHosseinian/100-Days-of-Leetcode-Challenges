### 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
|Easy

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
``` 

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100
